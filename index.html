      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="summary">Hi, my name is Grace, I am an aeronautical engineering and mechanical engineering major.I am especially interested in optimization in engineering - using both theory and data-driven methods. From my past experiences, I have also developed interests in automotive technology, precision control of mechanical systems, and design for assembly. My prior experience as an apprentice mechanic and the chassis/suspension manufacturing lead at Rensselaer Motorsport also makes me highly knowledgable with both internal combustion and electric-powered vehicles. I am currently seeking an internship for the spring or the summer of 2025, as a researcher or as a mechanical or aeronautical engineer.</p>
